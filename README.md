# Advanced  convolutional neural network (CNN)
In this repository, we will walk through some of the most popular CNNs/algorithms that were state-of-the-art at their times and can still be worked as the base of many well-performimg vision-based models, networks like Inception, ResNet, and MobileNet developed in 2014,2015, and 2017 respectively.

We also review YOLO implementation from scratch to delve deeper into the object detection algorithms.

It is worth mentioning that all these tutorials have been prepared and/or collected for educational purposes.
