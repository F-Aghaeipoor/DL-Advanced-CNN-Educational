# Advanced  convolutional neural network (CNN)
In this repository, we will walk through the most popular CNNs that were state-of-the-art at their times and can still work as the base of many well-performimg vision-based models, networks like Inception and ResNet developed in 2014 and 2015 respectively. 

It is worth mentioning that all these tutorials have been prepared and collected for educational purposes.
